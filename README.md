# mkv-to-mp4-conveter
This program converts the mkv to mp4 that too it converts Hx265 to H.264 codec
I am believing that your pc has ffmpeg and ffprobe installed in your pc.
If you don't have it then download it and add it to the environment variable of computer.
You can see any YoutTube video that show how to insert any program to environment variable of pc.
That's it. It is done.
Just edit the file path in the program and then run it. I am sure that it won't disappoint you.
Why I created this program is because lots of people out there complain that videos are not supported in their TV's and DVD Player.
You can convert the video using this program and then run it in your TV/DVD.
